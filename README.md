# Model-Classification-Explainability-on-custom-ResNet50-using-GradCAM
GradCAM technique utilizes the gradients of the classification score with respect to the final convolutional feature map, to identify the parts of an input image that most impact the classification score.  In this scenario, the model was used to classify lung diseases using chest CT images.
